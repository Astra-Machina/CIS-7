The video that I found the most interesting and helpful was [Discrete Math 2] Recurrence Relations. This video help clarify what I needed to do for the Towers of Hanoi assignment a couple of weeks ago. It helped me understand what I had to figure out first; which was to understand the formula that the puzzle used to be solved. I then had to put it to code, but I accidentally passed the disks from the source tower to the auxillary instead of the goal; once I realized that and changed my program, it began to work as it should and properly print out each towers' contents.
