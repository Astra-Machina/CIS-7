The video that I found the most interesting and helpful was [Discrete Math 2] Recurrence Relations. This video help clarify what I needed to do for the Towers of Hanoi assignment a couple of weeks ago. It helped me understand what I had to figure out first; which was to understand the formula that the puzzle used to be solved. After finding the pattern, I then had to put it into code, which I had a bit of trouble with getting it to pass the correct values, but after a bit of debugging, I realized that I was passing the number of disks to the auxillary tower instead of the goal. Once I realized this, I was able to get the program to run as it should and complete the assignment.
